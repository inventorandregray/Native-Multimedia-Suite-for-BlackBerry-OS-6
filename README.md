# OS 6 Version Enhancements

A fully native **BlackBerry OS 6 Java ME multimedia app**, similar in structure to the OS 5 suite but optimized for OS 6 with **touch support**, **improved UI**, and **better media handling**.  
While OS 6 introduced **WebKit integration**, this version remains focused on **pure Java ME**, leveraging components like `MainScreen`, `ButtonField`, `BitmapField`, and `VideoControl`.

## ðŸš€ Enhancements

### 1. Touch Support
- Buttons handle both **trackball/keyboard navigation** and **touch events** (`TouchEvent.CLICK`).  

### 2. Optimized UI
- `BitmapField` updates dynamically for **image slideshow**.  
- Buttons use **Runnable callbacks** for cleaner, modular code.  

### 3. Improved Video & Audio Playback
- Uses **.3gp format** for wider OS 6 support.  
- Stops previous media before starting a new track/video to **avoid conflicts**.  

### 4. Clean Resource Management
- Ensures **media players** are closed on app exit.  
- Prevents **memory leaks** on low-memory devices.
